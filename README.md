# cvPython
idk why I made my cv in python


dependencies are tk, customtkinter, webbrowser(native)

I don't expect anyone to run this, but get a venv first. Because otherwise python can do what python does most of the time.

then do pip install tk, pip install customtkinter

I included pngs, have everything under the same folder

python cv.py on the folder

bada bing bada boom 

now you have my cv on python GUI 

thank you for listening.
